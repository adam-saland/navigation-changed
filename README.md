# Detecting Navigation Changes

This repository demonstrates **one** possible method for detecting navigation changes from an OpenFin View

## How to use

- clone the repository
- `npm i | npm install`
- `npm start`

## Demonstration Steps / Expected behavior

1. Two devtools windows will open upon starting the application
2. With a url of `http://localhost:5555/platform-window.html`, corresponding with the platform's defaultWindow.
    1. This devtools window should have a log statement reading
  `ORIGINAL URL http://localhost:5555/navigation-changed.html`
3. With a url of `http://localhost:5555/navigation-changed.html` corresponding with the existing view.
4. Select the button labeled "Change Location"
   1. The open devtools with the url from **step 1** should have a log statement reading `NEW URL https://www.google.com/`
5. From the devtools console in **step 2** enter the api call `fin.me.navigateBack()`
   1. The devtools window from **step 1** should now have a log statement reading `NEW URL http://localhost:5555/navigation-changed.html`
